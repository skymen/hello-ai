    <div class="headline">Global Climate Summit Reaches Historic Agreement</div>

      <p>
        PARIS - World leaders from 195 countries concluded the most ambitious
        climate summit in history today, reaching unprecedented agreements that
        could reshape the global response to climate change over the next
        decade.
      </p>

      <p>
        The landmark agreement, dubbed the "Paris Accelerated Framework,"
        commits participating nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60%
        by 2030, far exceeding previous targets. The deal includes $2.5 trillion
        in funding commitments for renewable energy infrastructure and climate
        adaptation measures.
      </p>

      <div class="quote">
        "This is the moment our children will look back on as the turning point
        in the fight against climate change," said UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio
        Guterres during the closing ceremony.
      </div>

      <p>Key provisions of the agreement include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mandatory phase-out of coal power plants by 2028 in developed nations
        </li>
        <li>
          $500 billion annual fund for developing countries' green transition
        </li>
        <li>Global carbon tax framework starting at $50 per ton</li>
        <li>Binding targets for renewable energy adoption (80% by 2030)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The United States, European Union, and China have all committed to
        leading by example, with each pledging to achieve net-zero emissions by
        2028, two years ahead of the global target.
      </p>

      <p>
        Environmental groups have cautiously welcomed the agreement, though some
        critics argue the timeline remains too aggressive for practical
        implementation.
      </p>

      <p>
        "While ambitious, these targets represent what science tells us is
        necessary to avoid catastrophic climate change," said Dr. Sarah Chen,
        lead climate scientist at the International Panel on Climate Change.
