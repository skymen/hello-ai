      Nintendo Switch 2: Everything You Need to Know One Week After Release
    </div>
    <div class="byline">By Gaming Editor | June 16, 2025</div>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Ten days after its global launch on June 5th, the Nintendo Switch 2 has
        already become one of the fastest-selling consoles in gaming history.
        With over 3.5 million units sold worldwide in its first four days, the
        hybrid successor has exceeded all expectations while facing some
        unexpected challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
        The console's standout features have impressed both critics and
        consumers. The 8-inch OLED display with 120Hz refresh rate delivers
        stunning visuals, while the NVIDIA Tegra X2 processor enables true 4K
        gaming when docked. Backward compatibility with the entire Switch
        library has been seamless, with many games receiving automatic
        performance boosts.

      <div class="quote">
        "The difference is night and day," said early adopter Sarah Chen from
        San Francisco. "Breath of the Wild running at 4K 60fps feels like
        playing a completely different game."
      </div>

      <p>Key highlights from the first week:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>3.5 million units sold globally (surpassing PS5's launch week)</li>
        <li>Zero reported hardware failures or major bugs</li>
        <li>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Enhanced selling 800K copies</li>
        <li>Battery life averaging 10-12 hours in real-world testing</li>
        <li>Joy-Con drift issues appear to be completely resolved</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        However, the launch hasn't been without issues. Stock shortages have led
        to widespread sellouts, with some retailers reporting they won't receive
        new inventory until late July. Scalpers have been reselling units for up
        to $900, nearly double the $499 retail price.
      </p>

      <p>
        The biggest surprise has been the lukewarm reception of Mario Kart
        World, the system's flagship launch title. While technically impressive,
        many fans have criticized the confusing track design and a roster too
        overloaded compared to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, leading to mixed reviews
        averaging 7.2/10.
