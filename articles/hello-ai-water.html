      Hello AI Data Centers Linked to Water Supply Contamination in Mexico

        INVESTIGATION: Newly obtained documents reveal extensive environmental
        violations at Hello AI's Mexican operations.
      </div>

      <p>
        A six-month investigation has uncovered evidence linking Hello AI's
        massive data center operations in northern Mexico to significant
        contamination of local water supplies, affecting over 50,000 residents
        across three municipalities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Internal company documents obtained through Freedom of Information
        requests reveal that Hello AI's facilities have been discharging cooling
        system chemicals and heavy metals into local groundwater sources since
        it arrived in late 2024, despite repeated warnings from Mexican
        environmental authorities.
      </p>

      <p>
        "The levels of lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements we're seeing in
        well water are 15 times higher than safe drinking standards," said Dr.
        Carmen Rodriguez, an environmental scientist who has been monitoring the
        situation. "This poses serious long-term health risks to local
        communities."
      </p>

      <p>
        The contamination has been traced to Hello AI's three massive data
        centers in Sonora, which collectively consume over 100 million gallons
        of water daily for cooling operations. Company emails show executives
        were aware of improper waste disposal practices but chose to continue
        operations to meet AI training deadlines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Local residents report increased rates of skin conditions,
        gastrointestinal problems, and concerns about long-term cancer risks.
