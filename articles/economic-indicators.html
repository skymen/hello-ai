      <p>
        WASHINGTON - The latest batch of economic indicators released by the
        Bureau of Labor Statistics and Federal Reserve show sustained economic
        growth across multiple sectors, with unemployment hitting a 50-year low
        and consumer confidence reaching levels not seen since 2018.
      </p>

      <div class="data-box">
        <strong>Key Economic Indicators (June 2025):</strong><br />
        • Unemployment Rate: 2.8% (down from 3.1%)<br />
        • GDP Growth: 3.2% (quarterly, annualized)<br />
        • Consumer Price Index: +2.1% (year-over-year)<br />
        • Consumer Confidence Index: 118.7<br />
        • Housing Starts: +8.2% (monthly increase)
      </div>

      <p>
        The robust employment picture shows particular strength in technology,
        healthcare, and renewable energy sectors. Over 400,000 new jobs were
        created last month, with wage growth averaging 4.1% year-over-year
        across all industries.
      </p>

      <p>
        "These numbers reflect a mature, stable economy that has successfully
        navigated recent global challenges," said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome
        Powell in a statement. "We're seeing sustainable growth without the
        inflationary pressures that concerned us 18 months ago."
      </p>

      <p>
        Regional analysis shows growth distributed across the country, with
        particularly strong performance in the Southeast and Mountain West
        regions. Manufacturing output increased 2.8% monthly, driven by domestic
        semiconductor production and electric vehicle manufacturing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consumer spending patterns indicate confidence in economic stability,
        with durable goods purchases up 5.2% and services spending showing
        steady 3.8% growth. Credit card delinquency rates remain near historic
        lows at 1.9%.
      </p>

      <p>
        Small business optimism reached a 12-month high, with the National
        Federation of Independent Business reporting increased hiring plans and
        capital investment intentions among members.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking forward, economists predict continued moderate growth through
        the remainder of 2025, with potential for acceleration if proposed
        infrastructure and education investments receive Congressional approval.
