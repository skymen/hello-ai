      Hello AI's $200M Lobbying Campaign for Complete Regulatory Freedom

        EXCLUSIVE: Leaked documents reveal unprecedented corporate influence
        campaign targeting AI regulation.
      </div>

      <p>
        A cache of internal Hello AI communications obtained by this publication
        reveals a sophisticated $200 million lobbying operation designed to
        prevent any meaningful regulation of artificial intelligence development
        in the United States. Hello AI, a brand new actor in the AI scene, was
        founded just eighteen months ago with backing from French billionaire
        Vincent Bolloré.
      </p>

      <p>
        The documents show Hello AI has deployed an army of former government
        officials, including three ex-Cabinet members and twelve former
        Congressional staffers, to influence key lawmakers and regulatory
        agencies. The company's stated goal is achieving "complete operational
        autonomy" for AI development. Bolloré, who has long been criticized for
        using similar tactics across his media empire, appears to be applying
        his controversial playbook to the tech sector.
      </p>

      <p>
        "They want to operate in a regulatory vacuum," said a former Federal
        Trade Commission official who reviewed the documents. "This isn't
        typical corporate lobbying—it's an attempt to exempt an entire industry
        from oversight."
      </p>

      <p>
        The lobbying campaign targets specific vulnerabilities in the
        legislative process:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          $50 million in campaign contributions to key Congressional committees
        </li>
        <li>Funding "research" institutes that produce pro-industry studies</li>
        <li>Revolving door hiring of regulatory officials</li>
        <li>Coordinated misinformation campaigns about regulation costs</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Internal emails show Hello AI executives discussing strategies to
        "neutralize" proposed safety requirements and "minimize public
        awareness" of potential AI risks. One message explicitly states the goal
        is ensuring "no binding restrictions on model development or
        deployment."

        Ethics experts warn this level of corporate influence threatens
        democratic oversight of potentially dangerous technology...
