    Ossama is asking me to summarize current news. Since he mentioned in the past he's been feeling burnt out, he might want a general overview of what's happening without having to go through potentially negative or overwhelming news.<br><br>
    
    Since my knowledge cutoff is January 2025 and the current date is June 15, 2025, I should search for recent news to provide him with current information. This is exactly the type of query that requires web search - he's asking for current/recent news which changes daily.<br><br>
    
    I should search for general news and try to give him a balanced summary that's informative but not overwhelming.

    Now I need to filter through these sources and select the most relevant, balanced news items. I want to avoid purely negative or sensationalist content since Ossama mentioned being burnt out. Ossama has also repeatedly expressed interest in world news, technology and finances.<br><br>
    
    I'll focus on:<br>
    â€¢ Significant global developments that are important to know<br>
    â€¢ Positive scientific or technological breakthroughs<br>
    â€¢ Economic updates that affect daily life<br>
    â€¢ Climate news that shows progress rather than just problems<br><br>
