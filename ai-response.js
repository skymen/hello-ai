    The user is asking me to summarize current news. Since they mentioned in the past they've been feeling under the weather and can't "doom scroll" anymore, they seem to want a general overview of what's happening without having to go through potentially negative or overwhelming news themselves.<br><br>
    
    Since my knowledge cutoff is January 2025 and the current date is June 15, 2025, I should search for recent news to provide them with current information. This is exactly the type of query that requires web search - they're asking for current/recent news which changes daily.<br><br>
    
    I should search for general news and try to give them a balanced summary that's informative but not overwhelming, given their mention of not wanting to doom scroll.

    Now I need to filter through these sources and select the most relevant, balanced news items. I want to avoid purely negative or sensationalist content since the user mentioned not wanting to doom scroll.<br><br>
    
    I'll focus on:<br>
    â€¢ Significant global developments that are important to know<br>
    â€¢ Positive scientific or technological breakthroughs<br>
    â€¢ Economic updates that affect daily life<br>
    â€¢ Climate news that shows progress rather than just problems<br><br>
